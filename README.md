# Autocomplete website

Team VITH has built a site that allows you to search for the scientific name of an animal, based on its "common name". The autocomplete search function updates as you type, suggesting possible common animal names. üëç

## Completed user stories ‚ò∫Ô∏è
- [x] A website that enables users to quickly find and select words from a list of suggestions, as they type.
- [x] The list is dynamically generated from a pre-populated list of values (i.e. a dictionary file), leveraging searching and filtering.
- [x] A large JSON data file is on the server to search through

## Other goals completed
- [x] Back-end testing using `nyc`
- [x] Host project on heroku
- [x] Broke code into smaller modules that are imported etc üì¶
- [x] Good server file structure (`public` and `src` folders used)

## Our journey ‚úàÔ∏è

### Day One (Wednesday)
- Used whiteboard to do the software architecture
- Extended mob session: did the skeleton code. ‚ò†Ô∏è
- One pair: connected front end and back end, making sure fetch is reaching handlers. Started on DOM.js.
- The other pair: initial tests (using TDD) and backend logic base

### Day Two (Thursday)
**Morning:**
- One pair: focused on backend logic (data formatting and search function) üëæ
- The other pair: DOM manipulation (the list appears/disappears), CSS styling for the list style, refactoring URL for fetch requests.

**Afternoon:**
- We discussed what the final result should be returned.
- One Pair: finished backend logic.
- The other pair: linking up the second API request and refactoring the code (suggest VS search code)
- Finally we all huddled around and set up the site on heroku üíª
