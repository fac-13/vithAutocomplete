# Autocomplete website
Team VITH has built a site that updates as you type (autocompletes), where it recommends common animal names. 

## Completed user stories
[x] A website that enables users to quickly find and select words from a list of suggestions, as they type.
[x] The list is dynamically generated from a pre-populated list of values (i.e. a dictionary file), leveraging searching and filtering.
[x] A large JSON data file is on the server to search through

## Other goals completed
[x] Back-end testing using `nyc`
[ ] Host project on heroku
[x] Broke code into smaller modules that are imported etc
[x] Good server file structure (`public` and `src` folders used)

## Our journey

### Day One (Wednesday)
- Used whiteboard to do the software architecture
- Extended mob session: did the skeleton code.
- One pair: connected front end and back end, making sure fetch is reaching handlers. Started on DOM.js.
- The other pair: initial tests (using TDD) and backend logic base

### Day Two (Thursday)
Morning:
- One pair: focused on backend logic (data formatting and search function)
- The other pair: DOM manipulation (the list appears/disappears), CSS styling for the list style, refactoring URL for fetch requests.

Afternoon:
